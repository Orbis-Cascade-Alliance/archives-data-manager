archives-data-manager
=====================

The Archives Data Manager (ADM) is a multi-platform Java-based desktop client 
application for archival data management that starts from the last release of 
the Archivist's Toolkit code base, mantaining and extending it, as needed, to 
allow it to be functional and useful for archival work in the future.

The Archivists' Toolkit (AT) is an open source, Java-based desktop client 
application for managing data describing archival collections.  For a full 
description of the application, refer to http://archiviststoolkit.org.

Several years ago, ongoing work on AT was discontinued.  ADM starts with the 
last release of the AT code base, maintaining and extending it, as needed.  
The first purpose is to make sure it is operational with ongoing releases of 
the Java Virtual Machine.  Later work will be done to make improvements and 
bug fixes, as needed.

Contributors to the Orbis Cascade Alliance's Archives West archival data 
repository (http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org) continue to depend on AT for 
constructing the metadata documents contained in Archives West and thus the 
need for ADM to provide continued support for the software.
